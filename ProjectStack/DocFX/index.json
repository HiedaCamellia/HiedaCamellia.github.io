    "summary": "ProjectStack C# game template for Godot 4 with debug launch configurations, testing (locally and on CI/CD), code coverage, dependency update checks, and spell check working out-of-the-box! \uD83E\uDD5A Getting Started This template allows you to easily create a C# game for Godot 4. Microsoft's dotnet tool allows you to easily create, install, and use templates. # Install this template dotnet new install ProjectStack # Generate a new project based on this template dotnet new chickengame --name \"MyGameName\" --param:author \"My Name\" cd MyGameName dotnet build \uD83D\uDC81 Getting Help Is this template broken? Encountering obscure C# build problems? We'll be happy to help you in the Chickensoft Discord server. \uD83C\uDFDD Environment Setup For the provided debug configurations and test coverage to work correctly, you must setup your development environment correctly. The Chickensoft Setup Docs describe how to setup your Godot and C# development environment, using Chickensoft's best practice recommendations. VSCode Settings This template includes some Visual Studio Code settings in .vscode/settings.json. The settings facilitate terminal environments on Windows (Git Bash, PowerShell, Command Prompt) and macOS (zsh), as well as fixing some syntax colorization issues that Omnisharp suffers from. You'll also find settings that enable editor config support in Omnisharp and the .NET Roslyn analyzers for a more enjoyable coding experience. Please double-check that the provided VSCode settings don't conflict with your existing settings. .NET Versioning The included global.json specifies the version of the .NET SDK and Godot.NET.Sdk that the game should use. Using a global.json file allows Renovatebot to provide your repository with automatic dependency update pull requests whenever a new version of GodotSharp is released. \uD83D\uDC77 Testing An example test is included in test/src/GameTest.cs that demonstrates how to write a test for your package using GoDotTest and godot-test-driver. GoDotTest is an easy-to-use testing framework for Godot and C# that allows you to run tests from the command line, collect code coverage, and debug tests in VSCode. Tests run directly inside the game. The .csproj file is already pre-configured to prevent test scripts and test-only package dependencies from being included in release builds of your game! On CI/CD, software graphics drivers from [mesa] emulate a virtual graphics device for Godot to render to, allowing you to run visual tests in a headless environment. \uD83C\uDFC1 Application Entry Point The Main.tscn and Main.cs scene and script file are the entry point of your game. In general, you probably won't need to modify these unless you're doing something highly custom. If the game is running a release build, the Main.cs file will just immediately change the scene to src/Game.tscn. If the game is running in debug mode and GoDotTest has received the correct command line arguments to begin testing, the game will switch to the testing scene and hand off control to GoDotTest to run the game's tests. In general, prefer editing src/Game.tscn over src/Main.tscn. The provided debug configurations in .vscode/launch.json allow you to easily debug tests (or just the currently open test, provided its filename matches its class name). \uD83D\uDEA6 Test Coverage Code coverage requires a few dotnet global tools to be installed first. You should install these tools from the root of the project directory. The nuget.config file in the root of the project allows the correct version of coverlet to be installed from the coverlet nightly distributions. Overriding the coverlet version will be required until coverlet releases a stable version with the fixes that allow it to work with Godot 4. dotnet tool install --global coverlet.console dotnet tool update --global coverlet.console dotnet tool install --global dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool dotnet tool update --global dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool Running dotnet tool update for the global tool is often necessary on Apple Silicon computers to ensure the tools are installed correctly. You can collect code coverage and generate coverage badges by running the bash script coverage.sh (on Windows, you can use the Git Bash shell that comes with git). # Must give coverage script permission to run the first time it is used. chmod +x ./coverage.sh # Run code coverage: ./coverage.sh You can also run test coverage through VSCode by opening the command palette and selecting Tasks: Run Task and then choosing coverage. If you are having trouble with coverlet finding your .NET runtime on Windows, you can use the PowerShell Script coverage.ps1 instead. .\\coverage.ps1 ⏯ Running the Project Several launch profiles are included for Visual Studio Code: \uD83D\uDD79 Debug Game Runs the game in debug mode, allowing you to set breakpoints and inspect variables. \uD83C\uDFAD Debug Current Scene Debugs the game and loads the scene with the same name and in the same path as the C# file that's actively selected in VSCode: e.g., a scene named MyScene.tscn must reside in the same directory as MyScene.cs, and you must have selected MyScene.cs as the active tab in VSCode before running the launch profile. If GoDotTest is able to find a .tscn file with the same name in the same location, it will run the game in debug mode and load the scene. Naturally, Chickensoft recommends naming scenes after the C# script they use and keeping them in the same directory so that you can take advantage of this launch profile. ⚠️ It's very easy to rename a script class but forget to rename the scene file, or vice-versa. When that happens, this launch profile will pass in the expected name of the scene file based on the script's name, but Godot will fail to find a scene with that name since the script name and scene name are not the same. \uD83E\uDDEA Debug Tests Runs the game in debug mode, specifying the command line flags needed by GoDotTest to run the tests. Debugging works the same as usual, allowing you to set breakpoints within the game's C# test files. \uD83D\uDD2C Debug Current Test Debugs the game and loads the test class with the same name as the C# file that's actively selected in VSCode: e.g., a test file named MyTest.cs must contain a test class named MyTest, and you must have selected MyTest.cs as the active tab in VSCode before running the launch profile. ⚠️ It's very easy to rename a test class but forget to rename the test file, or vice-versa. When that happens, this launch profile will pass in the name of the file but GoDotTest will fail to find a class with that name since the filename and class name are not the same. Note that each launch profile will trigger a build (see ./.vscode/tasks.json) before debugging the game. ⚠️ Important: You must setup a GODOT environment variable for the launch configurations above. If you haven't done so already, please see the Chickensoft Setup Docs. \uD83C\uDFED CI/CD This game includes various GitHub Actions workflows to help with development. \uD83D\uDEA5 Tests Tests run directly inside the GitHub runner machine (using chickensoft-games/setup-godot) on every push to the repository. If the tests fail to pass, the workflow will also fail to pass. You can configure which simulated graphics environments (vulkan and/or opengl3) you want to run tests on in .github/workflows/visual_tests.yaml. Currently, tests can only be run from the ubuntu runners. If you know how to make the workflow install mesa and a virtual window manager on macOS and Windows, we'd love to hear from you! Tests are executed by running the Godot test project in ProjectStack from the command line and passing in the relevant arguments to Godot so that GoDotTest can discover and run tests. \uD83E\uDDD1‍\uD83C\uDFEB Spellcheck A spell check runs on every push to the repository. The spellcheck workflow settings can be configured in .github/workflows/spellcheck.yaml. The Code Spell Checker plugin for VSCode is recommended to help you catch typos before you commit them. If you need add a word to the dictionary or ignore a certain path, you can edit the project's cspell.json file. You can also words to the local cspell.json file from VSCode by hovering over a misspelled word and selecting Quick Fix... and then Add \"{word}\" to config: cspell.json. \uD83D\uDDC2 Version Change The included workflow in .github/workflows/version_change.yaml can be manually dispatched to open a pull request that replaces the version number in ProjectStack.csproj with the version you specify in the workflow's inputs. \uD83D\uDCE6 Publish to Nuget The included workflow in .github/workflows/publish.yaml can be manually dispatched when you're ready to publish your package to Nuget. To publish to nuget, you need a repository or organization secret named NUGET_API_KEY that contains your Nuget API key. The NUGET_API_KEY must be a GitHub actions secret to keep it safe! \uD83C\uDFDA Renovatebot This repository includes a renovate.json configuration for use with Renovatebot. Renovatebot can automatically open pull requests to help you keep your dependencies up to date when it detects new dependency versions have been released. Because Godot has such a rapid release cycle, automating dependency updates can be a huge time saver if you're trying to stay on the latest version of Godot. Unlike Dependabot, Renovatebot is able to combine all dependency updates into a single pull request — a must-have for Godot C# repositories where each sub-project needs the same Godot.NET.Sdk versions. If dependency version bumps were split across multiple repositories, the builds would fail in CI. The easiest way to add Renovatebot to your repository is to install it from the GitHub Marketplace. Note that you have to grant it access to each organization and repository you want it to monitor. The included renovate.json includes a few configuration options to limit how often Renovatebot can open pull requests as well as regex's to filter out some poorly versioned dependencies to prevent invalid dependency version updates. \uD83D\uDC23 Package generated from a \uD83D\uDC24 Chickensoft Template — https://chickensoft.games"

    "summary": "CardMeta 类 命名空间 ProjectStack.Common.Card 程序集 ProjectStack.dll An advanced Godot.Variant type. All classes in the engine inherit from Object. Each class may define new properties, methods or signals, which are available to all inheriting classes. For example, a Godot.Sprite2D instance is able to call Godot.Node.AddChild(Godot.Node, bool, Godot.Node.InternalMode) because it inherits from Godot.Node. You can create new instances, using Object.new() in GDScript, or new GodotObject in C#. To delete an Object instance, call Godot.GodotObject.Free(). This is necessary for most classes inheriting Object, because they do not manage memory on their own, and will otherwise cause memory leaks when no longer in use. There are a few classes that perform memory management. For example, Godot.RefCounted (and by extension Godot.Resource) deletes itself when no longer referenced, and Godot.Node deletes its children when freed. Objects can have a Godot.Script attached to them. Once the Godot.Script is instantiated, it effectively acts as an extension to the base class, allowing it to define and inherit new properties, methods and signals. Inside a Godot.Script, Godot.GodotObject._GetPropertyList() may be overridden to customize properties in several ways. This allows them to be available to the editor, display as lists of options, sub-divide into groups, save on disk, etc. Scripting languages offer easier ways to customize properties, such as with the [annotation @GDScript.@export] annotation. Godot is very dynamic. An object's script, and therefore its properties, methods and signals, can be changed at run-time. Because of this, there can be occasions where, for example, a property required by a method may not exist. To prevent run-time errors, see methods such as Godot.GodotObject.Set(Godot.StringName, Godot.Variant), Godot.GodotObject.Get(Godot.StringName), Godot.GodotObject.Call(Godot.StringName, params Godot.Variant[]), Godot.GodotObject.HasMethod(Godot.StringName), Godot.GodotObject.HasSignal(Godot.StringName), etc. Note that these methods are much slower than direct references. In GDScript, you can also check if a given property, method, or signal name exists in an object with the in operator: var node = Node.new() print(\"name\" in node) # Prints true print(\"get_parent\" in node) # Prints true print(\"tree_entered\" in node) # Prints true print(\"unknown\" in node) # Prints false Notifications are int constants commonly sent and received by objects. For example, on every rendered frame, the Godot.SceneTree notifies nodes inside the tree with a Godot.Node.NotificationProcess. The nodes receive it and may call Godot.Node._Process(double) to update. To make use of notifications, see Godot.GodotObject.Notification(int, bool) and Godot.GodotObject._Notification(int). Lastly, every object can also contain metadata (data about data). Godot.GodotObject.SetMeta(Godot.StringName, Godot.Variant) can be useful to store information that the object itself does not depend on. To keep your code clean, making excessive use of metadata is discouraged. Note: Unlike references to a Godot.RefCounted, references to an object stored in a variable can become invalid without being set to null. To check if an object has been deleted, do not compare it against null. Instead, use @GlobalScope.is_instance_valid. It's also recommended to inherit from Godot.RefCounted for classes storing data instead of Godot.GodotObject. Note: The script is not exposed like most properties. To set or get an object's Godot.Script in code, use Godot.GodotObject.SetScript(Godot.Variant) and Godot.GodotObject.GetScript(), respectively.

SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion(ref TaskNotifier?, Task?, Action<Task?>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given field (which should be the backing field for a property). If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the field and then raises the PropertyChanged event. This method is just like SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion(ref TaskNotifier?, Task?, string?), with the difference being an extra System.Action<T> parameter with a callback being invoked either immediately, if the new task has already completed or is null, or upon completion. protected bool SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion(ref CardMeta.TaskNotifier? taskNotifier, Task? newValue, Action<Task?> callback, string? propertyName = null) 参数 taskNotifier CardMeta.TaskNotifier The field notifier to modify. newValue Task The property's value after the change occurred. callback Action<Task> A callback to invoke to update the property value. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same. SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion(ref TaskNotifier?, Task?, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given field (which should be the backing field for a property). If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the field and then raises the PropertyChanged event. The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method will also monitor the new value of the property (a generic System.Threading.Tasks.Task) and will also raise the PropertyChanged again for the target property when it completes. This can be used to update bindings observing that System.Threading.Tasks.Task or any of its properties. This method and its overload specifically rely on the CardMeta.TaskNotifier type, which needs to be used in the backing field for the target System.Threading.Tasks.Task property. The field doesn't need to be initialized, as this method will take care of doing that automatically. The CardMeta.TaskNotifier type also includes an implicit operator, so it can be assigned to any System.Threading.Tasks.Task instance directly. Here is a sample property declaration using this method: private TaskNotifier myTask; public Task MyTask { get => myTask; private set => SetAndNotifyOnCompletion(ref myTask, value); } protected bool SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion(ref CardMeta.TaskNotifier? taskNotifier, Task? newValue, string? propertyName = null) 参数 taskNotifier CardMeta.TaskNotifier The field notifier to modify. newValue Task The property's value after the change occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same. The return value being true only indicates that the new value being assigned to taskNotifier is different than the previous one, and it does not mean the new System.Threading.Tasks.Task instance passed as argument is in any particular state. SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion<T>(ref TaskNotifier<T>?, Task<T>?, Action<Task<T>?>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given field (which should be the backing field for a property). If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the field and then raises the PropertyChanged event. This method is just like SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion<T>(ref TaskNotifier<T>?, Task<T>?, string?), with the difference being an extra System.Action<T> parameter with a callback being invoked either immediately, if the new task has already completed or is null, or upon completion. protected bool SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion<T>(ref CardMeta.TaskNotifier<T>? taskNotifier, Task<T>? newValue, Action<Task<T>?> callback, string? propertyName = null) 参数 taskNotifier CardMeta.TaskNotifier<T> The field notifier to modify. newValue Task<T> The property's value after the change occurred. callback Action<Task<T>> A callback to invoke to update the property value. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 T The type of result for the System.Threading.Tasks.Task<TResult> to set and monitor. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same. SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion<T>(ref TaskNotifier<T>?, Task<T>?, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given field (which should be the backing field for a property). If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the field and then raises the PropertyChanged event. The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method will also monitor the new value of the property (a generic System.Threading.Tasks.Task) and will also raise the PropertyChanged again for the target property when it completes. This can be used to update bindings observing that System.Threading.Tasks.Task or any of its properties. This method and its overload specifically rely on the CardMeta.TaskNotifier<T> type, which needs to be used in the backing field for the target System.Threading.Tasks.Task property. The field doesn't need to be initialized, as this method will take care of doing that automatically. The CardMeta.TaskNotifier<T> type also includes an implicit operator, so it can be assigned to any System.Threading.Tasks.Task instance directly. Here is a sample property declaration using this method: private TaskNotifier<int> myTask; public Task<int> MyTask { get => myTask; private set => SetAndNotifyOnCompletion(ref myTask, value); } protected bool SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion<T>(ref CardMeta.TaskNotifier<T>? taskNotifier, Task<T>? newValue, string? propertyName = null) 参数 taskNotifier CardMeta.TaskNotifier<T> The field notifier to modify. newValue Task<T> The property's value after the change occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 T The type of result for the System.Threading.Tasks.Task<TResult> to set and monitor. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same. The return value being true only indicates that the new value being assigned to taskNotifier is different than the previous one, and it does not mean the new System.Threading.Tasks.Task<TResult> instance passed as argument is in any particular state. SetProperty<T>(T, T, Action<T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property with the new value, then raises the PropertyChanged event. This overload is much less efficient than SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?) and it should only be used when the former is not viable (eg. when the target property being updated does not directly expose a backing field that can be passed by reference). For performance reasons, it is recommended to use a stateful callback if possible through the SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?) whenever possible instead of this overload, as that will allow the C# compiler to cache the input callback and reduce the memory allocations. More info on that overload are available in the related XML docs. This overload is here for completeness and in cases where that is not applicable. protected bool SetProperty<T>(T oldValue, T newValue, Action<T> callback, string? propertyName = null) 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. callback Action<T> A callback to invoke to update the property value. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 T The type of the property that changed. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same. SetProperty<T>(T, T, IEqualityComparer<T>, Action<T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property with the new value, then raises the PropertyChanged event. See additional notes about this overload in SetProperty<T>(T, T, Action<T>, string?). protected bool SetProperty<T>(T oldValue, T newValue, IEqualityComparer<T> comparer, Action<T> callback, string? propertyName = null) 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. comparer IEqualityComparer<T> The System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer<T> instance to use to compare the input values. callback Action<T> A callback to invoke to update the property value. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 T The type of the property that changed.

SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, IEqualityComparer<T>, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given nested property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property and then raises the PropertyChanged event. The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method is used to relay properties from a wrapped model in the current instance. See additional notes about this overload in SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?). protected bool SetProperty<TModel, T>(T oldValue, T newValue, IEqualityComparer<T> comparer, TModel model, Action<TModel, T> callback, string? propertyName = null) where TModel : class 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. comparer IEqualityComparer<T> The System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer<T> instance to use to compare the input values. model TModel The model containing the property being updated. callback Action<TModel, T> The callback to invoke to set the target property value, if a change has occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 TModel The type of model whose property (or field) to set. T The type of property (or field) to set. SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given nested property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property and then raises the PropertyChanged event. The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method is used to relay properties from a wrapped model in the current instance. This type is useful when creating wrapping, bindable objects that operate over models that lack support for notification (eg. for CRUD operations). Suppose we have this model (eg. for a database row in a table): public class Person { public string Name { get; set; } } We can then use a property to wrap instances of this type into our observable model (which supports notifications), injecting the notification to the properties of that model, like so: [ObservableObject] public class BindablePerson { public Model { get; } public BindablePerson(Person model) { Model = model; } public string Name { get => Model.Name; set => Set(Model.Name, value, Model, (model, name) => model.Name = name); } } This way we can then use the wrapping object in our application, and all those \"proxy\" properties will also raise notifications when changed. Note that this method is not meant to be a replacement for SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), and it should only be used when relaying properties to a model that doesn't support notifications, and only if you can't implement notifications to that model directly (eg. by having it inherit from ObservableObject). The syntax relies on passing the target model and a stateless callback to allow the C# compiler to cache the function, which results in much better performance and no memory usage. protected bool SetProperty<TModel, T>(T oldValue, T newValue, TModel model, Action<TModel, T> callback, string? propertyName = null) where TModel : class 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. model TModel The model containing the property being updated. callback Action<TModel, T> The callback to invoke to set the target property value, if a change has occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 TModel The type of model whose property (or field) to set. T The type of property (or field) to set. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same. 事件 PropertyChanged Occurs when a property value changes. public event PropertyChangedEventHandler?

    "summary": "ProjectStack.Common.Card 命名空间 类 CardMeta An advanced Godot.Variant type. All classes in the engine inherit from Object. Each class may define new properties, methods or signals, which are available to all inheriting classes. For example, a Godot.Sprite2D instance is able to call Godot.Node.AddChild(Godot.Node, bool, Godot.Node.InternalMode) because it inherits from Godot.Node. You can create new instances, using Object.new() in GDScript, or new GodotObject in C#. To delete an Object instance, call Godot.GodotObject.Free(). This is necessary for most classes inheriting Object, because they do not manage memory on their own, and will otherwise cause memory leaks when no longer in use. There are a few classes that perform memory management. For example, Godot.RefCounted (and by extension Godot.Resource) deletes itself when no longer referenced, and Godot.Node deletes its children when freed. Objects can have a Godot.Script attached to them. Once the Godot.Script is instantiated, it effectively acts as an extension to the base class, allowing it to define and inherit new properties, methods and signals. Inside a Godot.Script, Godot.GodotObject._GetPropertyList() may be overridden to customize properties in several ways. This allows them to be available to the editor, display as lists of options, sub-divide into groups, save on disk, etc. Scripting languages offer easier ways to customize properties, such as with the [annotation @GDScript.@export] annotation. Godot is very dynamic. An object's script, and therefore its properties, methods and signals, can be changed at run-time. Because of this, there can be occasions where, for example, a property required by a method may not exist. To prevent run-time errors, see methods such as Godot.GodotObject.Set(Godot.StringName, Godot.Variant), Godot.GodotObject.Get(Godot.StringName), Godot.GodotObject.Call(Godot.StringName, params Godot.Variant[]), Godot.GodotObject.HasMethod(Godot.StringName), Godot.GodotObject.HasSignal(Godot.StringName), etc. Note that these methods are much slower than direct references. In GDScript, you can also check if a given property, method, or signal name exists in an object with the in operator: var node = Node.new() print(\"name\" in node) # Prints true print(\"get_parent\" in node) # Prints true print(\"tree_entered\" in node) # Prints true print(\"unknown\" in node) # Prints false Notifications are int constants commonly sent and received by objects. For example, on every rendered frame, the Godot.SceneTree notifies nodes inside the tree with a Godot.Node.NotificationProcess. The nodes receive it and may call Godot.Node._Process(double) to update. To make use of notifications, see Godot.GodotObject.Notification(int, bool) and Godot.GodotObject._Notification(int). Lastly, every object can also contain metadata (data about data). Godot.GodotObject.SetMeta(Godot.StringName, Godot.Variant) can be useful to store information that the object itself does not depend on. To keep your code clean, making excessive use of metadata is discouraged. Note: Unlike references to a Godot.RefCounted, references to an object stored in a variable can become invalid without being set to null. To check if an object has been deleted, do not compare it against null. Instead, use @GlobalScope.is_instance_valid. It's also recommended to inherit from Godot.RefCounted for classes storing data instead of Godot.GodotObject. Note: The script is not exposed like most properties. To set or get an object's Godot.Script in code, use Godot.GodotObject.SetScript(Godot.Variant) and Godot.GodotObject.GetScript(), respectively.

This can be used to update bindings observing that System.Threading.Tasks.Task or any of its properties. This method and its overload specifically rely on the Card.TaskNotifier type, which needs to be used in the backing field for the target System.Threading.Tasks.Task property. The field doesn't need to be initialized, as this method will take care of doing that automatically.

SetProperty<T>(T, T, Action<T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property with the new value, then raises the PropertyChanged event. This overload is much less efficient than SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?) and it should only be used when the former is not viable (eg. when the target property being updated does not directly expose a backing field that can be passed by reference). For performance reasons, it is recommended to use a stateful callback if possible through the SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?) whenever possible instead of this overload, as that will allow the C# compiler to cache the input callback and reduce the memory allocations. More info on that overload are available in the related XML docs. This overload is here for completeness and in cases where that is not applicable. protected bool SetProperty<T>(T oldValue, T newValue, Action<T> callback, string? propertyName = null) 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. callback Action<T> A callback to invoke to update the property value. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 T The type of the property that changed. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same.

If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property and then raises the PropertyChanged event. The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method is used to relay properties from a wrapped model in the current instance. See additional notes about this overload in SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?). protected bool SetProperty<TModel, T>(T oldValue, T newValue, IEqualityComparer<T> comparer, TModel model, Action<TModel, T> callback, string? propertyName = null) where TModel : class 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. comparer IEqualityComparer<T> The System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer<T> instance to use to compare the input values. model TModel The model containing the property being updated. callback Action<TModel, T> The callback to invoke to set the target property value, if a change has occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 TModel The type of model whose property (or field) to set.

If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property and then raises the PropertyChanged event. The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method is used to relay properties from a wrapped model in the current instance. This type is useful when creating wrapping, bindable objects that operate over models that lack support for notification (eg. for CRUD operations). Suppose we have this model (eg. for a database row in a table): public class Person { public string Name { get; set; } } We can then use a property to wrap instances of this type into our observable model (which supports notifications), injecting the notification to the properties of that model, like so: [ObservableObject] public class BindablePerson { public Model { get; } public BindablePerson(Person model) { Model = model; } public string Name { get => Model.Name; set => Set(Model.Name, value, Model, (model, name) => model.Name = name); } } This way we can then use the wrapping object in our application, and all those \"proxy\" properties will also raise notifications when changed. Note that this method is not meant to be a replacement for SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), and it should only be used when relaying properties to a model that doesn't support notifications, and only if you can't implement notifications to that model directly (eg. by having it inherit from ObservableObject). The syntax relies on passing the target model and a stateless callback to allow the C# compiler to cache the function, which results in much better performance and no memory usage. protected bool SetProperty<TModel, T>(T oldValue, T newValue, TModel model, Action<TModel, T> callback, string? propertyName = null) where TModel : class 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. model TModel The model containing the property being updated. callback Action<TModel, T> The callback to invoke to set the target property value, if a change has occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 TModel The type of model whose property (or field) to set. T The type of property (or field) to set. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same.

See also Godot.GodotObject.Notification(int, bool). public override void _Notification(int what) { if (what == NotificationPredelete) { GD.Print(\"Goodbye!\"); } } Note: The base Godot.GodotObject defines a few notifications (Godot.GodotObject.NotificationPostinitialize and Godot.GodotObject.NotificationPredelete). Inheriting classes such as Godot.Node define a lot more notifications, which are also received by this method. public override void _Notification(int what) 参数 what int _Process(double) 主进程。 public override void _Process(double delta) 参数 delta double _Ready() Called when the node is \"ready\", i.e. when both the node and its children have entered the scene tree. If the node has children, their Godot.Node._Ready() callbacks get triggered first, and the parent node will receive the ready notification afterwards. Corresponds to the Godot.Node.NotificationReady notification in Godot.GodotObject._Notification(int). See also the @onready annotation for variables. Usually used for initialization. For even earlier initialization, Godot.GodotObject.GodotObject() may be used. See also Godot.Node._EnterTree(). Note: This method may be called only once for each node. After removing a node from the scene tree and adding it again, Godot.Node._Ready() will not be called a second time. This can be bypassed by requesting another call with Godot.Node.RequestReady(), which may be called anywhere before adding the node again. public override void _Ready() 事件 CardStackChanged 当卡堆发生变化时触发。 public event Action<ICardStack>?

    "summary": "InfoTab 类 命名空间 ProjectStack.Component 程序集 ProjectStack.dll Base class for all UI-related nodes. Godot.Control features a bounding rectangle that defines its extents, an anchor position relative to its parent control or the current viewport, and offsets relative to the anchor. The offsets update automatically when the node, any of its parents, or the screen size change. For more information on Godot's UI system, anchors, offsets, and containers, see the related tutorials in the manual. To build flexible UIs, you'll need a mix of UI elements that inherit from Godot.Control and Godot.Container nodes. User Interface nodes and input Godot propagates input events via viewports. Each Godot.Viewport is responsible for propagating Godot.InputEvents to their child nodes. As the Godot.SceneTree.Root is a Godot.Window, this already happens automatically for all UI elements in your game. Input events are propagated through the Godot.SceneTree from the root node to all child nodes by calling Godot.Node._Input(Godot.InputEvent). For UI elements specifically, it makes more sense to override the virtual method Godot.Control._GuiInput(Godot.InputEvent), which filters out unrelated input events, such as by checking z-order, Godot.Control.MouseFilter, focus, or if the event was inside of the control's bounding box. Call Godot.Control.AcceptEvent() so no other node receives the event. Once you accept an input, it becomes handled so Godot.Node._UnhandledInput(Godot.InputEvent) will not process it. Only one Godot.Control node can be in focus. Only the node in focus will receive events. To get the focus, call Godot.Control.GrabFocus(). Godot.Control nodes lose focus when another node grabs it, or if you hide the node in focus. Sets Godot.Control.MouseFilter to Godot.Control.MouseFilterEnum.Ignore to tell a Godot.Control node to ignore mouse or touch events. You'll need it if you place an icon on top of a button. Godot.Theme resources change the Control's appearance. If you change the Godot.Theme on a Godot.Control node, it affects all of its children. To override some of the theme's parameters, call one of the add_theme_*_override methods, like Godot.Control.AddThemeFontOverride(Godot.StringName, Godot.Font). You can override the theme with the Inspector. Note: Theme items are not Godot.GodotObject properties. This means you can't access their values using Godot.GodotObject.Get(Godot.StringName) and Godot.GodotObject.Set(Godot.StringName, Godot.Variant). Instead, use the get_theme_* and add_theme_*_override methods provided by this class.

This can be used to update bindings observing that System.Threading.Tasks.Task or any of its properties. This method and its overload specifically rely on the InfoTab.TaskNotifier type, which needs to be used in the backing field for the target System.Threading.Tasks.Task property. The field doesn't need to be initialized, as this method will take care of doing that automatically. The InfoTab.TaskNotifier type also includes an implicit operator, so it can be assigned to any System.Threading.Tasks.Task instance directly. Here is a sample property declaration using this method: private TaskNotifier myTask; public Task MyTask { get => myTask; private set => SetAndNotifyOnCompletion(ref myTask, value); } protected bool SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion(ref InfoTab.TaskNotifier? taskNotifier, Task? newValue, string? propertyName = null) 参数 taskNotifier InfoTab.TaskNotifier The field notifier to modify. newValue Task The property's value after the change occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same. The return value being true only indicates that the new value being assigned to taskNotifier is different than the previous one, and it does not mean the new System.Threading.Tasks.Task instance passed as argument is in any particular state. SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion<T>(ref TaskNotifier<T>?, Task<T>?, Action<Task<T>?>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given field (which should be the backing field for a property). If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the field and then raises the PropertyChanged event. This method is just like SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion<T>(ref TaskNotifier<T>?, Task<T>?, string?), with the difference being an extra System.Action<T> parameter with a callback being invoked either immediately, if the new task has already completed or is null, or upon completion. protected bool SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion<T>(ref InfoTab.TaskNotifier<T>? taskNotifier, Task<T>? newValue, Action<Task<T>?> callback, string? propertyName = null) 参数 taskNotifier InfoTab.TaskNotifier<T> The field notifier to modify. newValue Task<T> The property's value after the change occurred. callback Action<Task<T>> A callback to invoke to update the property value. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 T The type of result for the System.Threading.Tasks.Task<TResult> to set and monitor. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same.

The return value being true only indicates that the new value being assigned to taskNotifier is different than the previous one, and it does not mean the new System.Threading.Tasks.Task<TResult> instance passed as argument is in any particular state. SetProperty<T>(T, T, Action<T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property with the new value, then raises the PropertyChanged event. This overload is much less efficient than SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?) and it should only be used when the former is not viable (eg. when the target property being updated does not directly expose a backing field that can be passed by reference). For performance reasons, it is recommended to use a stateful callback if possible through the SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?) whenever possible instead of this overload, as that will allow the C# compiler to cache the input callback and reduce the memory allocations. More info on that overload are available in the related XML docs. This overload is here for completeness and in cases where that is not applicable. protected bool SetProperty<T>(T oldValue, T newValue, Action<T> callback, string? propertyName = null) 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. callback Action<T> A callback to invoke to update the property value. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 T The type of the property that changed. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same. SetProperty<T>(T, T, IEqualityComparer<T>, Action<T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property with the new value, then raises the PropertyChanged event. See additional notes about this overload in SetProperty<T>(T, T, Action<T>, string?). protected bool SetProperty<T>(T oldValue, T newValue, IEqualityComparer<T> comparer, Action<T> callback, string? propertyName = null) 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. comparer IEqualityComparer<T> The System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer<T> instance to use to compare the input values. callback Action<T> A callback to invoke to update the property value. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 T The type of the property that changed.

SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, IEqualityComparer<T>, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given nested property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property and then raises the PropertyChanged event. The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method is used to relay properties from a wrapped model in the current instance. See additional notes about this overload in SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?). protected bool SetProperty<TModel, T>(T oldValue, T newValue, IEqualityComparer<T> comparer, TModel model, Action<TModel, T> callback, string? propertyName = null) where TModel : class 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. comparer IEqualityComparer<T> The System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer<T> instance to use to compare the input values. model TModel The model containing the property being updated. callback Action<TModel, T> The callback to invoke to set the target property value, if a change has occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 TModel The type of model whose property (or field) to set. T The type of property (or field) to set. SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given nested property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property and then raises the PropertyChanged event. The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method is used to relay properties from a wrapped model in the current instance. This type is useful when creating wrapping, bindable objects that operate over models that lack support for notification (eg. for CRUD operations). Suppose we have this model (eg. for a database row in a table): public class Person { public string Name { get; set; } } We can then use a property to wrap instances of this type into our observable model (which supports notifications), injecting the notification to the properties of that model, like so: [ObservableObject] public class BindablePerson { public Model { get; } public BindablePerson(Person model) { Model = model; } public string Name { get => Model.Name; set => Set(Model.Name, value, Model, (model, name) => model.Name = name); } } This way we can then use the wrapping object in our application, and all those \"proxy\" properties will also raise notifications when changed. Note that this method is not meant to be a replacement for SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), and it should only be used when relaying properties to a model that doesn't support notifications, and only if you can't implement notifications to that model directly (eg. by having it inherit from ObservableObject). The syntax relies on passing the target model and a stateless callback to allow the C# compiler to cache the function, which results in much better performance and no memory usage. protected bool SetProperty<TModel, T>(T oldValue, T newValue, TModel model, Action<TModel, T> callback, string? propertyName = null) where TModel : class 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. model TModel The model containing the property being updated. callback Action<TModel, T> The callback to invoke to set the target property value, if a change has occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 TModel The type of model whose property (or field) to set. T The type of property (or field) to set. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same. _Notification(int) Called when the object receives a notification, which can be identified in what by comparing it with a constant. See also Godot.GodotObject.Notification(int, bool). public override void _Notification(int what) { if (what == NotificationPredelete) { GD.Print(\"Goodbye!\"); } } Note: The base Godot.GodotObject defines a few notifications (Godot.GodotObject.NotificationPostinitialize and Godot.GodotObject.NotificationPredelete). Inheriting classes such as Godot.Node define a lot more notifications, which are also received by this method. public override void _Notification(int what) 参数 what int 事件 PropertyChanged Occurs when a property value changes. public event PropertyChangedEventHandler?

    "summary": "ProjectStack.Component 命名空间 类 Card A 2D game object, with a transform (position, rotation, and scale). All 2D nodes, including physics objects and sprites, inherit from Node2D. Use Node2D as a parent node to move, scale and rotate children in a 2D project. Also gives control of the node's render order. Card.TaskNotifier A wrapping class that can hold a System.Threading.Tasks.Task value. Card.TaskNotifier<T> A wrapping class that can hold a System.Threading.Tasks.Task<TResult> value. InfoTab Base class for all UI-related nodes. Godot.Control features a bounding rectangle that defines its extents, an anchor position relative to its parent control or the current viewport, and offsets relative to the anchor. The offsets update automatically when the node, any of its parents, or the screen size change. For more information on Godot's UI system, anchors, offsets, and containers, see the related tutorials in the manual. To build flexible UIs, you'll need a mix of UI elements that inherit from Godot.Control and Godot.Container nodes. User Interface nodes and input Godot propagates input events via viewports. Each Godot.Viewport is responsible for propagating Godot.InputEvents to their child nodes. As the Godot.SceneTree.Root is a Godot.Window, this already happens automatically for all UI elements in your game. Input events are propagated through the Godot.SceneTree from the root node to all child nodes by calling Godot.Node._Input(Godot.InputEvent). For UI elements specifically, it makes more sense to override the virtual method Godot.Control._GuiInput(Godot.InputEvent), which filters out unrelated input events, such as by checking z-order, Godot.Control.MouseFilter, focus, or if the event was inside of the control's bounding box. Call Godot.Control.AcceptEvent() so no other node receives the event. Once you accept an input, it becomes handled so Godot.Node._UnhandledInput(Godot.InputEvent) will not process it. Only one Godot.Control node can be in focus. Only the node in focus will receive events. To get the focus, call Godot.Control.GrabFocus(). Godot.Control nodes lose focus when another node grabs it, or if you hide the node in focus. Sets Godot.Control.MouseFilter to Godot.Control.MouseFilterEnum.Ignore to tell a Godot.Control node to ignore mouse or touch events. You'll need it if you place an icon on top of a button. Godot.Theme resources change the Control's appearance. If you change the Godot.Theme on a Godot.Control node, it affects all of its children. To override some of the theme's parameters, call one of the add_theme_*_override methods, like Godot.Control.AddThemeFontOverride(Godot.StringName, Godot.Font). You can override the theme with the Inspector. Note: Theme items are not Godot.GodotObject properties. This means you can't access their values using Godot.GodotObject.Get(Godot.StringName) and Godot.GodotObject.Set(Godot.StringName, Godot.Variant). Instead, use the get_theme_* and add_theme_*_override methods provided by this class. InfoTab.TaskNotifier A wrapping class that can hold a System.Threading.Tasks.Task value. InfoTab.TaskNotifier<T> A wrapping class that can hold a System.Threading.Tasks.Task<TResult> value."

Godot.Control features a bounding rectangle that defines its extents, an anchor position relative to its parent control or the current viewport, and offsets relative to the anchor. The offsets update automatically when the node, any of its parents, or the screen size change. For more information on Godot's UI system, anchors, offsets, and containers, see the related tutorials in the manual. To build flexible UIs, you'll need a mix of UI elements that inherit from Godot.Control and Godot.Container nodes. User Interface nodes and input Godot propagates input events via viewports. Each Godot.Viewport is responsible for propagating Godot.InputEvents to their child nodes. As the Godot.SceneTree.Root is a Godot.Window, this already happens automatically for all UI elements in your game. Input events are propagated through the Godot.SceneTree from the root node to all child nodes by calling Godot.Node._Input(Godot.InputEvent). For UI elements specifically, it makes more sense to override the virtual method Godot.Control._GuiInput(Godot.InputEvent), which filters out unrelated input events, such as by checking z-order, Godot.Control.MouseFilter, focus, or if the event was inside of the control's bounding box. Call Godot.Control.AcceptEvent() so no other node receives the event. Once you accept an input, it becomes handled so Godot.Node._UnhandledInput(Godot.InputEvent) will not process it. Only one Godot.Control node can be in focus. Only the node in focus will receive events. To get the focus, call Godot.Control.GrabFocus(). Godot.Control nodes lose focus when another node grabs it, or if you hide the node in focus. Sets Godot.Control.MouseFilter to Godot.Control.MouseFilterEnum.Ignore to tell a Godot.Control node to ignore mouse or touch events. You'll need it if you place an icon on top of a button. Godot.Theme resources change the Control's appearance. If you change the Godot.Theme on a Godot.Control node, it affects all of its children. To override some of the theme's parameters, call one of the add_theme_*_override methods, like Godot.Control.AddThemeFontOverride(Godot.StringName, Godot.Font). You can override the theme with the Inspector. Note: Theme items are not Godot.GodotObject properties. This means you can't access their values using Godot.GodotObject.Get(Godot.StringName) and Godot.GodotObject.Set(Godot.StringName, Godot.Variant). Instead, use the get_theme_* and add_theme_*_override methods provided by this class.

If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the field and then raises the PropertyChanged event. The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method will also monitor the new value of the property (a generic System.Threading.Tasks.Task) and will also raise the PropertyChanged again for the target property when it completes. This can be used to update bindings observing that System.Threading.Tasks.Task or any of its properties. This method and its overload specifically rely on the SingleTypeEditor.TaskNotifier type, which needs to be used in the backing field for the target System.Threading.Tasks.Task property. The field doesn't need to be initialized, as this method will take care of doing that automatically. The SingleTypeEditor.TaskNotifier type also includes an implicit operator, so it can be assigned to any System.Threading.Tasks.Task instance directly. Here is a sample property declaration using this method: private TaskNotifier myTask; public Task MyTask { get => myTask; private set => SetAndNotifyOnCompletion(ref myTask, value); } protected bool SetPropertyAndNotifyOnCompletion(ref SingleTypeEditor.TaskNotifier? taskNotifier, Task? newValue, string? propertyName = null) 参数 taskNotifier SingleTypeEditor.TaskNotifier The field notifier to modify. newValue Task The property's value after the change occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same.

Compares the current and new values for a given field (which should be the backing field for a property).

SetProperty<T>(T, T, Action<T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property with the new value, then raises the PropertyChanged event. This overload is much less efficient than SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?) and it should only be used when the former is not viable (eg. when the target property being updated does not directly expose a backing field that can be passed by reference). For performance reasons, it is recommended to use a stateful callback if possible through the SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?) whenever possible instead of this overload, as that will allow the C# compiler to cache the input callback and reduce the memory allocations. More info on that overload are available in the related XML docs.

The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method is used to relay properties from a wrapped model in the current instance.

If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property and then raises the PropertyChanged event. The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method is used to relay properties from a wrapped model in the current instance. This type is useful when creating wrapping, bindable objects that operate over models that lack support for notification (eg. for CRUD operations). Suppose we have this model (eg. for a database row in a table): public class Person { public string Name { get; set; } } We can then use a property to wrap instances of this type into our observable model (which supports notifications), injecting the notification to the properties of that model, like so: [ObservableObject] public class BindablePerson { public Model { get; } public BindablePerson(Person model) { Model = model; } public string Name { get => Model.Name; set => Set(Model.Name, value, Model, (model, name) => model.Name = name); } } This way we can then use the wrapping object in our application, and all those \"proxy\" properties will also raise notifications when changed. Note that this method is not meant to be a replacement for SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), and it should only be used when relaying properties to a model that doesn't support notifications, and only if you can't implement notifications to that model directly (eg. by having it inherit from ObservableObject). The syntax relies on passing the target model and a stateless callback to allow the C# compiler to cache the function, which results in much better performance and no memory usage. protected bool SetProperty<TModel, T>(T oldValue, T newValue, TModel model, Action<TModel, T> callback, string? propertyName = null) where TModel : class 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. model TModel The model containing the property being updated. callback Action<TModel, T> The callback to invoke to set the target property value, if a change has occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 TModel The type of model whose property (or field) to set.

Godot.Control features a bounding rectangle that defines its extents, an anchor position relative to its parent control or the current viewport, and offsets relative to the anchor. The offsets update automatically when the node, any of its parents, or the screen size change. For more information on Godot's UI system, anchors, offsets, and containers, see the related tutorials in the manual. To build flexible UIs, you'll need a mix of UI elements that inherit from Godot.Control and Godot.Container nodes. User Interface nodes and input Godot propagates input events via viewports. Each Godot.Viewport is responsible for propagating Godot.InputEvents to their child nodes. As the Godot.SceneTree.Root is a Godot.Window, this already happens automatically for all UI elements in your game. Input events are propagated through the Godot.SceneTree from the root node to all child nodes by calling Godot.Node._Input(Godot.InputEvent). For UI elements specifically, it makes more sense to override the virtual method Godot.Control._GuiInput(Godot.InputEvent), which filters out unrelated input events, such as by checking z-order, Godot.Control.MouseFilter, focus, or if the event was inside of the control's bounding box. Call Godot.Control.AcceptEvent() so no other node receives the event. Once you accept an input, it becomes handled so Godot.Node._UnhandledInput(Godot.InputEvent) will not process it. Only one Godot.Control node can be in focus. Only the node in focus will receive events. To get the focus, call Godot.Control.GrabFocus(). Godot.Control nodes lose focus when another node grabs it, or if you hide the node in focus. Sets Godot.Control.MouseFilter to Godot.Control.MouseFilterEnum.Ignore to tell a Godot.Control node to ignore mouse or touch events. You'll need it if you place an icon on top of a button. Godot.Theme resources change the Control's appearance. If you change the Godot.Theme on a Godot.Control node, it affects all of its children. To override some of the theme's parameters, call one of the add_theme_*_override methods, like Godot.Control.AddThemeFontOverride(Godot.StringName, Godot.Font). You can override the theme with the Inspector. Note: Theme items are not Godot.GodotObject properties. This means you can't access their values using Godot.GodotObject.Get(Godot.StringName) and Godot.GodotObject.Set(Godot.StringName, Godot.Variant). Instead, use the get_theme_* and add_theme_*_override methods provided by this class.

This method and its overload specifically rely on the ResourceEditor.TaskNotifier type, which needs to be used in the backing field for the target System.Threading.Tasks.Task property. The field doesn't need to be initialized, as this method will take care of doing that automatically. The ResourceEditor.TaskNotifier type also includes an implicit operator, so it can be assigned to any System.Threading.Tasks.Task instance directly.

This overload is much less efficient than SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?) and it should only be used when the former is not viable (eg. when the target property being updated does not directly expose a backing field that can be passed by reference). For performance reasons, it is recommended to use a stateful callback if possible through the SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?) whenever possible instead of this overload, as that will allow the C# compiler to cache the input callback and reduce the memory allocations. More info on that overload are available in the related XML docs. This overload is here for completeness and in cases where that is not applicable. protected bool SetProperty<T>(T oldValue, T newValue, Action<T> callback, string? propertyName = null) 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. callback Action<T> A callback to invoke to update the property value. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 T The type of the property that changed. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same. SetProperty<T>(T, T, IEqualityComparer<T>, Action<T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property with the new value, then raises the PropertyChanged event.

SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, IEqualityComparer<T>, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given nested property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property and then raises the PropertyChanged event. The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method is used to relay properties from a wrapped model in the current instance. See additional notes about this overload in SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?). protected bool SetProperty<TModel, T>(T oldValue, T newValue, IEqualityComparer<T> comparer, TModel model, Action<TModel, T> callback, string? propertyName = null) where TModel : class 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. comparer IEqualityComparer<T> The System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer<T> instance to use to compare the input values. model TModel The model containing the property being updated. callback Action<TModel, T> The callback to invoke to set the target property value, if a change has occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 TModel The type of model whose property (or field) to set. T The type of property (or field) to set. SetProperty<TModel, T>(T, T, TModel, Action<TModel, T>, string?) Compares the current and new values for a given nested property. If the value has changed, raises the PropertyChanging event, updates the property and then raises the PropertyChanged event. The behavior mirrors that of SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), with the difference being that this method is used to relay properties from a wrapped model in the current instance. This type is useful when creating wrapping, bindable objects that operate over models that lack support for notification (eg. for CRUD operations). Suppose we have this model (eg. for a database row in a table): public class Person { public string Name { get; set; } } We can then use a property to wrap instances of this type into our observable model (which supports notifications), injecting the notification to the properties of that model, like so: [ObservableObject] public class BindablePerson { public Model { get; } public BindablePerson(Person model) { Model = model; } public string Name { get => Model.Name; set => Set(Model.Name, value, Model, (model, name) => model.Name = name); } } This way we can then use the wrapping object in our application, and all those \"proxy\" properties will also raise notifications when changed. Note that this method is not meant to be a replacement for SetProperty<T>(ref T, T, string?), and it should only be used when relaying properties to a model that doesn't support notifications, and only if you can't implement notifications to that model directly (eg. by having it inherit from ObservableObject). The syntax relies on passing the target model and a stateless callback to allow the C# compiler to cache the function, which results in much better performance and no memory usage. protected bool SetProperty<TModel, T>(T oldValue, T newValue, TModel model, Action<TModel, T> callback, string? propertyName = null) where TModel : class 参数 oldValue T The current property value. newValue T The property's value after the change occurred. model TModel The model containing the property being updated. callback Action<TModel, T> The callback to invoke to set the target property value, if a change has occurred. propertyName string (optional) The name of the property that changed. 返回 bool true if the property was changed, false otherwise. 类型参数 TModel The type of model whose property (or field) to set. T The type of property (or field) to set. 备注 The PropertyChanging and PropertyChanged events are not raised if the current and new value for the target property are the same. _Notification(int) Called when the object receives a notification, which can be identified in what by comparing it with a constant. See also Godot.GodotObject.Notification(int, bool). public override void _Notification(int what) { if (what == NotificationPredelete) { GD.Print(\"Goodbye!\"); } } Note: The base Godot.GodotObject defines a few notifications (Godot.GodotObject.NotificationPostinitialize and Godot.GodotObject.NotificationPredelete). Inheriting classes such as Godot.Node define a lot more notifications, which are also received by this method. public override void _Notification(int what) 参数 what int _Process(double) Called during the processing step of the main loop. Processing happens at every frame and as fast as possible, so the delta time since the previous frame is not constant. delta is in seconds. It is only called if processing is enabled, which is done automatically if this method is overridden, and can be toggled with Godot.Node.SetProcess(bool). Corresponds to the Godot.Node.NotificationProcess notification in Godot.GodotObject._Notification(int). Note: This method is only called if the node is present in the scene tree (i.e. if it's not an orphan). public override void _Process(double delta) 参数 delta double _Ready() Called when the node is \"ready\", i.e. when both the node and its children have entered the scene tree. If the node has children, their Godot.Node._Ready() callbacks get triggered first, and the parent node will receive the ready notification afterwards. Corresponds to the Godot.Node.NotificationReady notification in Godot.GodotObject._Notification(int). See also the @onready annotation for variables. Usually used for initialization. For even earlier initialization, Godot.GodotObject.GodotObject() may be used. See also Godot.Node._EnterTree(). Note: This method may be called only once for each node. After removing a node from the scene tree and adding it again, Godot.Node._Ready() will not be called a second time. This can be bypassed by requesting another call with Godot.Node.RequestReady(), which may be called anywhere before adding the node again. public override void _Ready() 事件 PropertyChanged Occurs when a property value changes. public event PropertyChangedEventHandler? PropertyChanged 事件类型 PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanging Occurs when a property value is changing. public event PropertyChangingEventHandler?

    "summary": "ProjectStack 命名空间 类 CardTest Game Game.LoadingProgressChangedEventArgs Launcher Main ResourceEditor Base class for all UI-related nodes. Godot.Control features a bounding rectangle that defines its extents, an anchor position relative to its parent control or the current viewport, and offsets relative to the anchor. The offsets update automatically when the node, any of its parents, or the screen size change. For more information on Godot's UI system, anchors, offsets, and containers, see the related tutorials in the manual. To build flexible UIs, you'll need a mix of UI elements that inherit from Godot.Control and Godot.Container nodes. User Interface nodes and input Godot propagates input events via viewports. Each Godot.Viewport is responsible for propagating Godot.InputEvents to their child nodes. As the Godot.SceneTree.Root is a Godot.Window, this already happens automatically for all UI elements in your game. Input events are propagated through the Godot.SceneTree from the root node to all child nodes by calling Godot.Node._Input(Godot.InputEvent). For UI elements specifically, it makes more sense to override the virtual method Godot.Control._GuiInput(Godot.InputEvent), which filters out unrelated input events, such as by checking z-order, Godot.Control.MouseFilter, focus, or if the event was inside of the control's bounding box. Call Godot.Control.AcceptEvent() so no other node receives the event. Once you accept an input, it becomes handled so Godot.Node._UnhandledInput(Godot.InputEvent) will not process it. Only one Godot.Control node can be in focus. Only the node in focus will receive events. To get the focus, call Godot.Control.GrabFocus(). Godot.Control nodes lose focus when another node grabs it, or if you hide the node in focus. Sets Godot.Control.MouseFilter to Godot.Control.MouseFilterEnum.Ignore to tell a Godot.Control node to ignore mouse or touch events. You'll need it if you place an icon on top of a button. Godot.Theme resources change the Control's appearance. If you change the Godot.Theme on a Godot.Control node, it affects all of its children. To override some of the theme's parameters, call one of the add_theme_*_override methods, like Godot.Control.AddThemeFontOverride(Godot.StringName, Godot.Font). You can override the theme with the Inspector. Note: Theme items are not Godot.GodotObject properties. This means you can't access their values using Godot.GodotObject.Get(Godot.StringName) and Godot.GodotObject.Set(Godot.StringName, Godot.Variant). Instead, use the get_theme_* and add_theme_*_override methods provided by this class. ResourceEditor.TaskNotifier A wrapping class that can hold a System.Threading.Tasks.Task value. ResourceEditor.TaskNotifier<T> A wrapping class that can hold a System.Threading.Tasks.Task<TResult> value."
